Hi, I’m Aniket Desai, a B.Tech Electronics and Telecommunication (EXTC) student, graduating in 2027. I enjoy working on tech projects and building whatever I’m curious about. I like learning by doing and exploring ideas hands-on, whether it's through coding, electronics, or trying out something new.
